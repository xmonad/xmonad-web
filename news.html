<h3>
GNOME 3.0 to support tiling window management out of the box!
</h3>
</a>

<p>
The <a href="http://xmonad.org/">xmonad</a> project, the world's most
popular purely functional window manager, is pleased to announce an
exciting new collaboration with The Free Software Desktop Project,
creators of the well-known <A
    href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> desktop suite, to 
enhance and improve the core GNOME system with a focus on the upcoming
GNOME 3.0 release.
</p>

<p>
Addressing the concerns of GNOME users seeking better space utilisation
for window clients and less dependence on the mouse than existing
GNOME-compliant window managers provide, the new GNOME 3.0 release will
include a modified Metacity window manager based on xmonad's "<a
    href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad/docs/XMonad-StackSet.html">StackSet</a>"
framework for window tiling. Founded on a theory of <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipper_(data_structure)">generalised derivatives</a> of
datatypes, the tiling window management model is expected to produce
obvious improvements in productivity, scalability and ease of
use for GNOME users.
</p>

<p>
This transition to a "tiling-by-default" approach marks a turning
point in the history of the open source user interfaces, as the desktop
metaphor for user interaction is replaced by a more efficient "Rubik's
cube" model of window/workspace arrangment. 
</p>

<p>
The xmonad developers, along with Tuomo "tuomov" Valkonen of related Ion
window manager project, will also be working closely with the GNOME team
helping transition GNOME to new core components written in Haskell, upon which
a more robust, maintainable GNOME core will rely. This is expected to
greatly enhance the long term stability, performance and ease of
development of GNOME as GNOME developers are able to take advantage of
powerful user interface tools based on reactive programming, lazy
evaluation, co-monadic effects and delimited continuations, previously
unavailable to people who's name wasn't "Oleg".
</p>

<p>
The resulting combined GNOME/xmonad code base will also, of course,
benefit the xmonad project too, with new Perl, Python and C# components from
GNOME finding their way back into the xmonad codebase, greatly
increasing the feature range of xmonad, even for those users not using
GNOME components. By integrating Python and Perl support directly into
xmonad's core, developers will be able to smoothly script and extend the
standalone xmonad system without worrying about complicated type errors
slowing down development and preventing the impossible from happening.
</p>

<p>
We hope our users are as excited as the dev team about this new
collaboration, and expect to see lots of cool new features appearing in
the GNOME and xmonad codebases soon!

<h3>xmonad 0.7 released!</h3>
</a>

<p>
The xmonad dev team is pleased to announce <a href="http://xmonad.org">xmonad 0.7</a>!
</p>

<p>
The 0.7 release of xmonad provides several improvements over 0.6,
including improved <a href="http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Using_xmonad_in_Gnome">integration with GNOME</a>, more flexible "rules",
various stability fixes, and of course, many new and interesting
extensions in the extension library (general support for window
decorations, utf8 support, scratch pad terminals, pointer control) and
<a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Notable_changes_since_0.6">more</a>!
</p>

<p>
In the past year, the xmonad development team received contributions
from over 60 developers, making xmonad one of the largest window manager
development teams around, and dwarfing other tiling window manager
projects. Yet, at the same time, the core code base remains at around
1000 lines of code, with another 7000 lines in the extension library --
a significant achievment! Thank you all.
</p>

<h3>xmonad 0.6 released</h3>
</a>

<p>The xmonad dev team is pleased to announce the 0.6 release of <a
    href="http://xmonad.org">xmonad</a>! This is an incremental
release of xmonad, with some new features, and important bug fixes, so
we recommend upgrading to 0.6 if you're an xmonad 0.5 user. New features
include: focus-follows-mouse is configurable, cloned screens are
supported, and better support for docked apps. Many new extension
modules have been written, as usual.  The release can be found at <a
    href="http://xmonad.org">xmonad.org</a>, with full
documentation on installation, configuration and extension of your 
favourite tiling window manager. There are also changelogs for the <a
    href="http://xmonad.org/changelog-0.6.txt">core</a> and
<a href="http://xmonad.org/changelog-xmc-0.6.txt">extension library</a>.

<h3>xmonad 0.5 packages</h3>
</a>

<p>
The package maintainers have been hard at work this week, packaging up
the new xmonad 0.5 for various distros. Packages are very important, as
they make it a lot easier to get a Haskell toolchain into place. So far
the following agile distros ;) have packaged xmonad 0.5:
</p>
<ul>
    <li> <a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?do_Details=1&ID=10593">Arch</a> </li>
    <li> <a href="http://packages.gentoo.org/package/xmonad">Gentoo</a> </li>
    <li> <a href="http://pkgsrc.se/wip/xmonad">NetBSD</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>
While the following have xmonad 0.4 or earlier:
</p>

<ul>
    <li> <a href="http://ports.openbsd.nu/x11/xmonad">OpenBSD</a> </li>
    <li> <a href="http://www.freshports.org/x11-wm/xmonad/">FreeBSD</a> </li>
    <li> <a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/xmonad">Debian</a> </li>
    <li> <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/source/xmonad">Ubuntu</a> </li>
    <li> <a href="http://recipes.gobolinux.org/r/?list=XMonad">GoboLinux</a> </li>
    <li> <a href="http://distro.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/sourcemage/grimoire/codex/stable/windowmanagers/xmonad/">Source Mage</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>
Other well known distributions appear not to have xmonad at all - for shame!
xmonad's success relies much on the ability for users to install from
their package system, so if you're able to package xmonad for your
platform, please do so!

<h3>xmonad 0.5 released!</h3>
</a>

<P>The xmonad dev team is pleased to announce the 0.5 release of <A href="http://xmonad.org/">xmonad</A>! xmonad 0.5 is a major release of xmonad, allowing, for the first time, dynamic extension in Haskell without requiring recompilation. Extension and configuration of xmonad is now faster, simpler, and more flexible. All configuration is done via the ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs file. Example config files and screenshots are available on <A href="http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Config_archive">the wiki</A>. This release marks the final break from its dwm origins. As a result, xmonad is now also much easier to package, distribute and extend, as recompilation of xmonad is not required to extend it.
</P>

<P>As usual with xmonad, the new release comes with <A href="http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/xmonad-contrib-0.5">a large library</A> of extensions you can use in your config files.  Highlights include status bars, shell prompts, emulation of dwm, wmii and ion behaviour, and alternative window layout algorithms.  Check out <A href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib">the extension documentation</A> for more info. 
</P>

<P> More information, screenshots, documentation, tutorials and community resources are available from the <A href="http://xmonad.org/">xmonad home page</A>.  The 0.5 release, extensions and dependencies, are available from <A href="http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/xmonad">hackage.haskell.org</A>.
</P>

<P> Enjoy, and happy tiling!</P>

<h3>xmonad 0.5 release candidates</h3>
</a>

<p>
xmonad 0.5 release candidates are now available for those into beta testing.
Download <A href="http://xmonad.org/xmonad-0.4.20071204.tar.gz">xmonad</A> and
<A href="http://xmonad.org/xmonad-contrib-0.4.20071204.tar.gz">xmonad-contrib</A>
here.  You'll need X11 1.4 from hackage.haskell.org. These bundles should work
fine with ghc 6.6 or ghc 6.8, and they use the new ~/.xmonad/ configuration
system.  Documentation isn't up yet, so drop by the IRC channel if you get
stuck.  The more testing, the better the release!
